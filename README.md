# Tickets Buyer Project
This project was developed through the Alura development course, wich I learned how to:

- Use of the `parseInt` function in JavaScript, to convert a String value to an integer;
- Write functionality code in separate functions;
- Use of a conditional block to determine which function should be called, according to the value stored in a variable.
